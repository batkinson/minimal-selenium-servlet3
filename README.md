# Minimal Selenium Servlet3

A minimal maven project using selenium webdriver and testng with a servlet 3.0
application.

## Why?

I developed this to learn the basic mechanics of how servlet3 applications are
built, run and tested with Apach Maven. It also provides a clean example of how
a testable servlet3 application can be configured in Maven.

## Requirements

To build this project, you'll need:

  * [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) or a compatibile tool.

## Building

To build and test the project, simply run the following:

```
# Build, run and test the application
mvn verify
```
